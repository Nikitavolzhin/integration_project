# integration_project
This project discovers functionality of MLFlow as a tool for automation machine learning experiments. The task for machine learning is a simple numerical integration problem using 5 equally spaced nodes. The dataset_generation.ipynb file creates 2 datasets using some matrix multiplications and antiderivative properties. Both datasets contain 6 columns: the first 5 are values of some random functions at -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 correspondingly, and the last column is the value of the definite integral on [-2, 2] of this function. More functions are represented in the second dataset. The work with machine learning models using MLFlow is done in model_training.ipynb file. There is a Medium article complementing this project. One can find it by this link.
